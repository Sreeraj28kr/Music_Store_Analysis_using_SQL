# Music_Store_Analysis_using_SQL
🎯Objective: This project will show you how to analyze the digital music store database. I have examined the dataset with SQL and helped the store understand its business growth by answering simple and complex questions based on geographical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best customer in terms of purchase rate.
This analysis will provide great insight to the stakeholders to take right and effective decisions.
